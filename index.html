      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Devin - I'm 24. I recently left my job working in Bellevue as the warehouse 
        manager for a custom merchandising company and want to transition professionally 
        into the world of software development. I took some coding courses in college and 
        have done a little bit of independent research, but never dipped my toes into start 
        to finish, full-stack development. So I'm exciting to dive in!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        Malo, WA - it's a really small town in Eastern Washington, but it still has a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malo,_Washington">Wikipedia page</a>!
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        I like to cycle, rock climb, hang out in my hammock in the summertime, go on night walks 
        through the city, and read fantasy novels.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        Something in the sustainable technologies industry. I'm particularly passionate about 
        decentralized utilities structures - solar, rainwater collection, biogas generation, etc 
        - and I spend a lot of time thinking about what complementary technologies could be 
        developed in that space.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>The University District in Seattle!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        Because it's a very versatile skillset that would allow me to pursue or 
        pioneer a career within any of the industries that I'm personally passionate about.
